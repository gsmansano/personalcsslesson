      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>Music lover, games enjoyer and an adventurer finding his path on life. <br> Leaning programming was always a curiosity and an inner desire, but it always seemed distant. Then, life just happens, doors open and opportunity arises. We have to
        get up and go, follow the path our hearts show using our brains to make it work. It may look or sound scary, but there is no need to be afraid. <br> Well, I am not afraid to keep on living.</p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>Started studying programming in 2022. An unexplored desire becoming a life passion. The help of friends for the career shift was invaluable, just as the motivation from them. <br>
          Looking forward for the challenges ahead, the work and to make a change.</p>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>Since I can remember, music has always been an integral part of my life. Started to learn piano and guitar around 13 years old, formed my first band at 17. Since then, learned music production, produces tracks of varied styles and was part
          of several bands. </p>
